Summary:
- Several suspicious HTTP requests were detected. A POST request to `/login` resulted in an authentication failure (401), followed by attempts to access `/admin` (403) and `/secret` (404). These may indicate unauthorized access attempts and potential reconnaissance activity.

Recommendations:
1. Investigate the source IP addresses (192.168.1.101, 192.168.1.102, and 192.168.1.50) for further malicious activity. [Priority: High]
2. Monitor traffic to sensitive endpoints like `/admin` and `/secret` for unusual patterns. [Priority: Medium]
3. Review authentication logs for failed login attempts associated with IP 192.168.1.101. [Priority: Low]

Evidence to collect next:
- Full web server access logs for the relevant timeframe
- Authentication logs from the web server or associated identity provider
- Network traffic captures (PCAP) involving the suspicious IP addresses
